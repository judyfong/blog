I had been looking for an affordable and free way to read Icelandic books ever
since I started my Icelandic learning journey. However, whenever I went to
[Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) there would almost never be any
content for Icelandic. But then today I found [bækur.is][baekur website]. It is
an effort by the National and [University Library of
Iceland](https://landsbokasafn.is/) to digitize old Icelandic books. So it's
like Iceland's own Project Gutenberg or the [Internet Archive's Text
Archive](https://archive.org/details/texts) but funded by the national government.

There are several caveats though. First, as far as I had seen, none of the
digitized books have an html or epub version. They do allow you to read the
images of the books pages on their website or to download whole books as pdfs
for you to read at your own leisure. Also, you cannot search by language or
topic however you can search for keywords in the book titles, authors, and for
some books even the full text. This textual version does not seem to be
available publicly though, only as part of the search features within the book
and for the website.

However, there are also several great findings. First, a general discovery. For
some of the books you can even go into the immersive view and search for
keywords within the digitized text itself. This is especially great in my
second finding. This website has a digitized version of an [English-Icelandic
Dictionary by G.T. Zoega][eng-isl dict] and it's searchable in the immersive
view. I'm so excited because it brings all the benefits of a print dictionary
since there are similar words sorted in order but in a digital form.

Anyway, I hope you have as much fun with [baekur.is][baekur website] as I had
finding it!

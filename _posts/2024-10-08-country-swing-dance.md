Here are my notes on how to do some Country Swing moves. They are from the
[Háskóladansinn][haskoladansinn] class taught by organization's president,
Catherine O'hara.

## Pre-requisite and reviewed moves
First there are two to three pre-requisite moves. We went over these three
moves because some or all of the moves are required in order to execute the
five moves covered in this class.

1. Two-step
2. Beltloop
3. Inside turn

## The moves
Then, these relatively easy new moves were all taught in the same class session:

1. Arch (or lasso as I call it) + proposal
2. Windmill + Sweatheart
3. Head rolls
    a. follows
        1. Hands attached
        2. Hand on shoulder only
    b. leads
4. Anchor dip
5. Basic dip/sit

## The moves in-depth

### Arch (lasso)
The lead stays in one place but moves their hand like they are holding and
whipping a lasso. Then the follow makes a clockwise circle around the lead.

### Arch  + proposal
This move is the same for the follow but now the lead bends their right leg and
their left knee touches the ground.

### Windmill
For the Windmill, the lead lifts their right arm up behind them then sweeps it
down while holding the follow's hand. Around waist level, the lead uses their
left hand to grab the follows hand. This ends with the lead and the follow
having crossed hands in front. Then the lead can turn it into a sweatheart and
then use another Windmill to get out of the crossed hands position.

### Head rolls
Head rolls are done by only one partner at a time.

#### Follows
Follows have two types of head rolls. There's the hands attached head roll that
looks like an arm bar. Then there's the no-hands head roll.

#### Leads
Leads only have one type of head roll called the matrix. The lead head rolls by
putting the follow's hand on the lead's chest and then rolling their head under
the follow's arm like they are doing the limbo.

### Anchor dip
The follows are at a forty-five degree angle from the leads and the partners
have their arms locked at the elbow. The lead leans down a bit while the follow
basically does a pistol squat as low as they are comfortable with. It is
important for the follow to keep their center of balance over vertical.

### Basic dip/sit
First the two partners do an inside turn. Then the lead puts their hand on the
follows back. A hand straight down the back slightly indicates to sit. A hand
slightly backwards without moving down indicates the follow should do a dip.
The follow should still be supporting most of their own weight.

Finally we also did some line dancing during this class.

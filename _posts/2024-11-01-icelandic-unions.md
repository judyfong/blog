# Icelandic Unions (isl: stéttarfélag)
Iceland has many unions and they are a central component to getting overall
higher wages in Iceland. In addition to the direct work benefits. They also
have many other perks such as cabins in the countryside, some health
re-imbursements, and continuing education re-imbursements.

There's the [Icelandic Confederation of Labour (isl:Alþýðusamband Íslands
ASÍ)][asi] which is the largest collection of unions working together. At the
time of writing this blogpost, their membership consists of 47 unions.

ASÍ has a comprehensive guide on Icelandic labor law in both English and
Icelandic at

It's worth going over. For example, the section titled Contract of Employment
and related rules says that Fixed Term Employment may not be continuous for
more than two years. Fixed Term Contracts are another term for temporary
contracts. 

While most unions have additional benefits like vision, learning
reimbursements, increased vacation days, higher wages, some have much lower
monthly union dues and thus fewer benefits. Unions with a large concentration
of members in a specific company tend to like having one of them become a union
representative.

Some unions are closely tied to pension funds. For example, [VR][vr] is related
to [live.is][live] but they operate completely separately.

## Types of Unions
The biggest unions in Iceland are [VR][vr] and [Efling][efling]. BHM is a
umbrella union for university graduates.

There is a union for the software development field, called [Stéttarfélag
tölvungarfræðinga][vfi]. Their benefits are supposed to be pretty good.

Smelters are a big industry within Iceland so there are multiple unions.
Example, the Rio Tinto smelter workers are in these [five
unions][five-smelter-unions]: Félag rafeindavirkja, Félag íslenskra rafvirkja,
FIT, VM, and Hlíf.

## Eligibility
Not everyone can join all unions. Other professions with specialized unions are
bankers and teachers. For example, people without teaching degrees in schools
do not qualify for the teacher's union.
